# IoT Vibration Data Description Document\n\n## Overview\n\nThe IoT Vibration Data Description Document provides a comprehensive overview of the vibration data collected from IoT sensors. This data is crucial for monitoring and analyzing the operational conditions of machinery and equipment. The document details the structure and format of the data files, ensuring that users can effectively interpret and utilize the information.\n\n## Data File Structure\n\nThe vibration data is stored in JSON format, which is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. The data for each timestamp is split into three separate files, each corresponding to one of the three axes of measurement:\n\n1. Axial\n2. Vertical\n3. Horizontal\n\n### File Naming Convention\n\nEach file is named according to the following convention:\n\n<timestamp><axis>.json\n\n- <timestamp>: The exact time when the data was recorded, typically in ISO 8601 format (e.g., 2023-10-05T14:48:00Z).\n- <axis>: The axis of measurement (e.g., Axial, Vertical, Horizontal).\n\n### File Content\n\nEach JSON file contains the vibration data for a specific axis at a specific timestamp. The structure of the JSON file is as follows:\n\njson\n{\n    \"timestamp\": \"2023-10-05T14:48:00Z\",\n    \"axis\": \"Axial\",\n    \"data\": {\n        \"amplitude\": 12.34,\n        \"frequency\": 50.0,\n        \"units\": \"m/s^2\"\n    }\n}\n\n- timestamp: The exact time when the data was recorded.\n- axis: The axis of measurement (e.g., Axial, Vertical, Horizontal).\n- data: An object containing the vibration data.\n  - amplitude: The measured amplitude of the vibration.\n  - frequency: The frequency of the vibration.\n  - units: The units of measurement for the amplitude (e.g., m/s^2).\n\n### Example\n\nFor a timestamp of 2023-10-05T14:48:00Z, the files would be named as follows:\n\n- 2023-10-
